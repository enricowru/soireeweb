## Summary

I have successfully implemented the requested changes to the mobile app:

### 1. Fixed Profile Picture Fetching for Reviews ✅

**Problem**: In the reviews screen, profile pictures were not being displayed for user reviews.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `main/api/review_api.py` in the backend
- Changed the `list_mobile_reviews` function to include the user's profile picture URL instead of hardcoding it to `None`
- Now the API returns: `'avatar': r.user.profile_picture if r.user and r.user.profile_picture else None`

**Files Changed**:
- `d:\SYSTEMS\webpython\soireeweb\main\api\review_api.py`

### 2. Added Image Zoom Functionality for Package Images ✅

**Problem**: In booking screens, package images couldn't be zoomed or viewed full screen.

**Solution**:
- Created a new `FullScreenImageViewer` widget that displays images in full screen with zoom/pan capabilities
- Made the package image in the booking screen clickable to open the full-screen viewer
- Added smooth hero animation transition between the thumbnail and full-screen view
- Included a close button (X) to exit the full-screen view

**Features Added**:
- Full-screen image viewing with black background
- Interactive zoom and pan with `InteractiveViewer` (0.5x to 4x zoom)
- Hero animation for smooth transitions
- Close button in the app bar
- Proper error handling for failed image loads
- Loading indicator during image load

**Files Changed**:
- `mobileapp\lib\widgets\fullscreen_image_viewer.dart` (new file)
- `mobileapp\lib\screens\event_booking_screen.dart`

### How to Use the New Features

1. **Profile Pictures in Reviews**: Profile pictures will now automatically appear in the reviews screen for users who have uploaded profile pictures.

2. **Package Image Zoom**: In the booking screen's package step, tap on the package image to open it in full screen. You can:
   - Pinch to zoom in/out
   - Drag to pan around the image
   - Tap the X button or use the back button to close

### Technical Details

- The backend change ensures profile pictures are included in the review API response
- The full-screen viewer uses Flutter's `InteractiveViewer` for smooth zoom/pan interactions
- Hero animations provide a polished transition experience
- All existing functionality remains unaffected

Both changes are minimal, focused, and don't impact any other app functionality as requested.
