# SendGrid Sender Identity Verification Required

## Current Status
✅ SendGrid API key is working
✅ SMTP connection to SendGrid successful
❌ Sender identity not verified

## Issue
SendGrid requires you to verify the sender email address (`websoiree1@gmail.com`) before it can send emails.

## Solution - Verify Sender Identity

### Step 1: Access SendGrid Dashboard
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com
2. Log in to your SendGrid account

### Step 2: Verify Single Sender
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **"Verify a Single Sender"**
3. Fill out the form:
   - **From Name**: SoireeWeb Team
   - **From Email**: websoiree1@gmail.com
   - **Reply To**: websoiree1@gmail.com
   - **Company Address**: (any valid address)
   - **City**: (your city)
   - **State**: (your state)
   - **ZIP**: (your zip)
   - **Country**: (your country)

### Step 3: Check Email & Verify
1. SendGrid will send a verification email to `websoiree1@gmail.com`
2. Check the Gmail inbox for verification email
3. Click the verification link in the email
4. Confirm verification is complete

### Step 4: Test Again
Once verified, test the email functionality:
```bash
python manage.py test_email --to=websoiree1@gmail.com
```

## Expected Result After Verification
- ✅ SMTP connection successful
- ✅ Django send_mail successful  
- ✅ Test email delivered to inbox
- ✅ OTP emails will work in forgot password feature

## Timeline
- Verification typically takes a few minutes
- Once verified, emails start working immediately
- No code changes needed - just sender verification

The SendGrid connection is working perfectly - just need this one verification step!
